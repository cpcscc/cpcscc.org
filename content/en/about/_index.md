## Our Mission
Founded in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations, the Citizen's Privacy Coalition of Santa Clara County (CPC) exists to watch the watchers and empower the people of Santa Clara County, California. To combat the lack of oversight and awareness surrounding the state of government and corporate surveillance in the heart of Silicon Valley, the organization aims to investigate the surveillance capabilities and processes of all government organizations within the county and educate the public on the effects and implications of these overreaches. If necessary, the CPC is prepared to pressure law makers and promote legislation to curb the abuses of surveillance and other violations of privacy.

To further empower the county's citizens, the CPC also hosts regular training workshops to educate attendees how to evade and protect themselves from surveillance. Activists, journalists, members of under represented communities, immigrants, and other individuals particularly at-risk of surveillance are strongly encouraged to attend. The CPC stands firmly with members of these communities and strives to further enable them to protect themselves. There is strong evidence that suggests government surveillance disproportionately affects them.

The CPC stands firmly with under represented communities and believes that the county surveillance state disproporationately affects those groups. As such, the CPC regularly hosts anti-surveillance workshops are hosted regularly and members and activists within those communities are strongly encouraged to attend. Additionally, the CPC hosts a regular meetup with guest speakers to discuss topic relevant to its mission. You can see all the upcoming events here.
