The United States has a long history of surveilling activists. Come learn the basics of interferring with or evading surveillance when challenging the systems and fighting for what you believe in. Workshop open to everyone, but geared specifically towards activists. The content will largely be derived from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [Surveillance Self Defense Project](https://ssd.eff.org).

Will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch at the links above in partner with [San Jose Strong](http://sanjose-strong.com).
