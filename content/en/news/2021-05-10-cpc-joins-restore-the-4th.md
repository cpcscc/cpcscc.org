The Citizens Privacy Coalition of Santa Clara County is excited to announce becoming the newst chapter of [Restore the Fourth](https://restorethe4th.com/) (RT4). RT4 has been opposing unconstitutional mass government surveillance since 2013. We thought that mission lined up pretty nicely with ours. In fact, RT4 played a role in passing the nation's first surveillance oversight legislation right here in Santa Clara County. With the resources and partnership of RT4, we hope to continue fighiting effectively against abusive police surveillance in the South Bay. If you would like to join us and RT4, please [join here](/join) and check out our [upcoming events](/events).
