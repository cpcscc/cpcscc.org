The Citizens Privacy Coalition of Santa Clara County is proud to announce its acceptance into the [Electronic Frontier Alliance](https://eff.org/fight) (EFA). The EFA is run by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org) and "is a grassroots network of community and campus organizations across the United States working to educate our neighbors about the importance of digital rights."

As a member, we hold the following values [as written](https://eff.org/fight) by the EFA:

1. **Free Expression**: People should be able to speak their minds to whoever will listen.
2. **Security**: Technology should be trustworthy and answer to its users.
3. **Privacy**: Technology should allow private and anonymous speech, and allow users to set their own parameters about what to share with whom.
4. **Creativity**: Technology should promote progress by allowing people to build on the ideas, creations, and inventions of others.
5. **Access to knowledge**: Curiosity should be rewarded, not stifled.

If you would like to join us in our quest, now officially supported by the EFF, to fight surveillance in the South Bay, please [join here](/join) and check out our [upcoming events](/events).
